### *Project 1: Google Data Analytics Capstone*

This was the final project for my Google Data Analytics certificate. It was my first project where I used R and HTML to create the Markdown report in RStudio.
The purpose of the project was to prepare a report for a women's health tech company and answer three main questions for stakeholders:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

The prompt for the capstone can be found here: [Case-Study-2-_-How-can-a-wellness-technology-company-play-it-smart.pdf](https://github.com/Dudlst01/Portfolio/files/11357009/Case-Study-2-_-How-can-a-wellness-technology-company-play-it-smart.pdf)

### *Project 2: IBM Data Analytics Capstone*

This was the final result of my IBM Data Analytics capstone, where I was asked to make a dashboard and presentation based on the 2019 Stack Overflow 2019 Community Survey. I was asked to answer three questions:
1. What are the top programming languages in demand?
2. What are the top database skills in demand?
3. What are the top IDEs?
I used Excel to prepare and clean the data, used IBM Cognos to create a dashboard, and then used Microsoft PowerPoint to present the data.
