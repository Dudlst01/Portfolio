### *Project 1: Palmer Penguins Shiny Dashboard in R*

The purpose of this project was to explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset in R. The dataset was first processed to make naming conventions consistent and make the dataset easier to work with. Multivariate Analysis of Variances (MANOVAs) were conducted to examine differences between penguins based on species, sex, location, body mass, flipper length, and culmen length and depth. The difference between residuals and leverage were also plotted and calculated via Cook's Distance to observe how outlier scores affected the dataset. The analysis found that there were significant differences between species for flipper length and culmen length and depth. Additionally, there were significant differences between sex and body mass for all species. Some of the confounding variables include several outlier observations, which may have skewed the results of the analysis.

What I learned from this project is the importance of data cleaning and how certain statistical tests are not appropriate based on the type of data that you are working with. In addition, I learned about the strengths and limitations of Shiny Dashboards in R.


### *Project 2: Examining Customer Lifetime Value for a Airline Loyalty Program in Python*

The purpose of this project was to examine the performance of a fictional Canadian Airline's loyalty promotional event and adress the following business tasks:

#### 1. What impact did the campaign have on program memberships (gross / net)?
#### 2. Was the campaign adoption more successful for certain demographics of loyalty members?
#### 3. What impact did the campaign have on booked flights during summer?

What I learned from the project was how to answer business questions that provide immediate value for the business.
In addition, I also learned how to handle data transformations and class imbalances that can lead to biases or misinterpretations.
One of the main problems that I ran into was scope creep, so I refined my analysis so that it would be more concise and only address the business tasks.
